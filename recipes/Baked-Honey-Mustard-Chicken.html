    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A classic combination of honey and mustard spread over juicy chicken breast. Baked to a tender perfection, this wonderful combination provides an easy to make and healthy dinner! Only requiring 15 minutes of prep work, serve with steamed veggies or buttered rice noodles for an even more balanced meal.</p>
        <p>The lemon juice and mustard keep the chicken extra juicy and tender, while providing a sauce that covers each breast and seals in all essential juices. The sprigs of fresh rosemary adds the perfect amount of fresh herb flavor, and a slight texture from the coarsely ground mustard. A genius combination that'll leave you eating the sauce by the spoonful!</p>
